Before continuing, make sure you've done all the steps in the [installation](./installations.md) section.

## Step 1 - Register Page

First, we'll create the register page. This page will allow users to create an account on the application. We'll start by modifying a file in the `src` folder called `Register.js`. This file will contain the code for the register page.
